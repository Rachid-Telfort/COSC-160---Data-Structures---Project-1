# COSC-160---Data-Structures---Project-1
Project 1 from my Data Structures class while I attended Georgetown University

This project is the first of three projects from my Data Structures class while I attended Georgetown University.

This project is about the various operations that could be done on polynomials.

In this project, we were tasked with making a polynomial class using pointers and linked lists.

The reason for this was to focus on core concepts and fundamentals of data structures, programming, and C++ such as object-oriented programming, pointers, operator overloading, arithmetic, code design, and linked lists.

This implementation is my implementation after revisiting the project in order to revisit programming and computer science fundamentals.

I hope that my fellow GitHubians find this project useful and hopefully learn something from it.

Please let me know if one encounters any bugs or can think of ways of how to improve any aspect of the project, it will be much appreciated!
